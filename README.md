# Minespades
Minespades is a **Spigot (Bukkit)** plugin that adds a new game mode to Minecraft: pvp arenas or **battlegrounds**. It has many customizable features and allows you to create an infinite number of **arenas**, **teams** with their own flags, respawn points and much more. In addition, most of the plugin's features were implemented with a modern approach and with the idea that **everything should be customizable**.

## Building
`mvn clean package`

## Features and stuff
- **Completely destructible battlegrounds** with teams, where players can fight with each other. When the game on battleground ends, it will be restored to its default state and everything will start over!
- Two game modes: **TDM** and **CTF**. Kill as many players as you can, or bring the enemy flag to your base!
- Create **multigrounds**, which alternate different battlegrounds! Never play on the same map again!
- **Customize** your battlegrounds to exactly match your preferences! (**14+** battleground preferences at this moment)
- **Clever use of information displays** instead of endless chat spam: kill messages are displayed in the **actionbar**, player KDA and arena information are displayed in the **sidebar**, various game information is displayed in the **bossbar** (for example, the time until the flag is restored), as well as kill scores display in the **tablist**!
- **Async battleground loading** that never will be cause lag on your server!
