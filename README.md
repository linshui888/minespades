# CastleWars
CastleWars is a **Spigot (Bukkit)** plugin that adds a new game mode to Minecraft: pvp arenas or **battlegrounds**. It has many customizable features and allows you to create an infinite number of **arenas**, **teams** with their own flags, respawn points and much more. In addition, most of the plugin's features were implemented with a modern approach and with the idea that **everything should be customizable**.
