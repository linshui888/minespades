# Minespades
Have you ever played **Ace of Spades**? An old and now closed game that was popular for a while ten years ago. A mix of Minecraft and Team Fortress that takes the best from both games. I remember this game with warmth, and therefore decided to recreate it in Minecraft.

# TODO
- **Battleground engine**: arenas with massive functionality that stored in plugin folder and can be (re)-loaded anytime;
- Gunplay: aos-like weapons (i don't plan this far by now)
- Gameplay: intels, airstrikes, some test basic maps and so on
